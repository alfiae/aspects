# Aspects

## About
Aspects is a Minecraft mod that implements a few enchantments that are able to be disabled in its configuration file.
You may also modify the configuration file to allow multiple different aspects to be present on one item,
or to enable aspects on axes, shovels, pickaxes, and hoes.

Currently implemented aspects:
* Frost Aspect - Inflicts freezing.
* Earth Aspect - Inflicts blindness & slowness on enemies.
* Wind Aspect - Throws hit enemies into the air.
* Gravity Aspect - This aspect conflicts with Knockback along with the default confliction of normal aspects, besides the Earth Aspect.
Gravity Aspect and Earth Aspect can both be present on the same item by default, however this behavior can be disabled via the config.
* Blood Aspect - Grants the user life leeching abilities.
* Poison Aspect - Inflicts non-lethal poison.
* Wither Aspect - The method to obtain the Wither Aspect is different from a normal enchantment. To obtain the Wither Aspect, an item must first be enchanted
with Poison Aspect. Then, you must put both the item with Poison Aspect and a nether star into an anvil, where Poison Aspect
will merge with the nether star to create Wither Aspect. Wither Aspect **cannot** be applied to enchantment books. The Wither Aspect
also cannot be removed by grind stones.

Disabled aspects (overpowered and/or non-serious enchantments, possible to enable via config):
* Creeper Aspect - Creates an explosion whenever the item enchanted with it hits a solid block or entity.
* Dragon Aspect - When an item with this aspect is swung, it will create a dragon fireball and shoot it in that direction.
* Golden Aspect - When applied to an item, Golden Aspect will modify its enchantment glint to be golden. It will also completely
prevent that item from being destroyed, whether it be through lava, durability, or, mayhaps the bane of every item, ***cacti***.
Oh, it also inflicts absorption on living entities it hits.
